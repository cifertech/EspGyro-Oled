# EspGyro-Oled
With the help of the Giro MPU6050 module, we will get the values of x, y and z in 3D environment, and then we will display the values with the help of the OLED display and ESP8266 board.

## What it DO!
In this project, by launching the MPU6050 module, obtaining the values of X, Y, Z and finally printing them on the OLED display, we can see the mentioned values in an instant, since the project is launched with ESP8266 board, we will be able to Using the wifi feature, send values to a specific destination or display them on a web page, for example.

### Items needed
-MPU6050
-ESP8266
-Oled

### Required libraries
-ESP8266WiFi
-Adafruit_GFX
-Adafruit_SSD1306

## Conclusion
We will launch the module and print the values of X, Y, Z in the Arduino IDE software monitor series, and then by adding the OLED display to the circuit, we will be able to see the values in the OLED display as well.
